This is a quick page to preview the icons I am creating for some of my Java(TM) programs.  You are free to
use them in your programs,   but I am retaining Copyright,   and they can not be used in any books, CD-ROM's,
Web pages, or any other form of image collection without my consent.  I ask that if you do use them to drop
me some e-mail at dean@gallant.com, also, if a screen shot of your application using these icons is available I
will add a link to it from this page. I would please me greatly if you would add a little blurb in something like a
``Help about..'' screen like:

 The collection is somewhat small now,  but I will continue to add to it. Send me mail if you would like
something added. I hope to create a library of standard icons for many applications to use,  I would like 
for these icons to be the default icons for most Java(TM) freeware and  JFA Applications.  These icons 
are all 20x20 pixels, and look best at high color and high resolutions.  The ``by hand'' anti-aliasing I did 
looks best on a standard gray background.  I plan to produce a 16x16 subset.  I am working on some 
Swing based icon management tools and an icon editor that can deal with alpha channels properly. The 
following image is a grid of the current icons. A web browser may dither the image somewhat, so there may be
some artifacts. I look forward to your feedback.
