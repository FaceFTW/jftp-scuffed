		    basic and might not work with every feed.)
- 1.46-pre5	D. fixed some StatusCanvas UI glitches
- 1.46-pre4	D. initial date parsing support for unix-style ftp connections

- 1.45-pre4	D. added support for another ftp server date listing style -

- 1.45-pre4	D. set Settings.smallSize and smallSizeUp to zero which results in slower
		   communication for multiple small files, but prevents the app from 
		   freezing because of too much use of the control connection during
		   upload of multiple selected files via a fast connection
- 1.45-pre4	D. using repaint() plus revalidate() from other threads than the EDT without
		   SwingUtilities.invokeLater() now, which seems to fix most of the UI
		   glitches described below
- 1.45-pre3	D. moved from paintImmediately() to repaint() again, with the result that
		   the ui is a lot more responsive again. unfortunately this seems to lead
		   to some other kinds of glitches and stability issues like:
		   - missing scrollbars
		   - missing ui unlock after a transfer or delete action
		   - occasional app freeze (maybe related to multiple selections)
		   This will take some time to investigate, 
		   help of an UI expert is always welcome :)
- 1.45-pre3	D. added gui option to not save cleartext passwords anymore and
		   improved the password management system, some notes:
		   - all stored passwords are still saved in cleartext
		   - passwords are no longer saved per default
		   - passwords in the bookmarks file can be replaced using
		     Settings.hiddenPassword (currently: <%hidden%>), JFtp will
		     ask for a password then

- 1.42-pre1	D. added field to specify a WINS server IP to SMBHostChooser
		   as an attempt to fix SMB problems (bug 799534)

		    and hopefully all of the reported dataloss bugs. even though i still don't know
		    how file deletion can start itself on an appcrash the deletion of symlinks
		    pointing to other directories leads to the deletion of those. what happened to me
		    is that a symlink in a directory i wanted to delete pointed to my
		    homedir and i lost half of my personal data, including the latest prerelease
		    sourcecode. i'll release this version now as a bugfix-only release.
		    if you encounter any dataloss bugs with this version, please report them
		    immediately.
